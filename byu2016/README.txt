Drupal 7 Theme for BYU
=======================

This theme is written for Drupal 7, based on designs for the BYU Theme by Aleni Rasmussen.
 
It is based on 
    BOOTSTRAP version 3.3.7
and includes    
    JQUERY version 1.12.4
    FONT-AWESOME version 4.7.0
    
In order for the Site Titles to wrap nicely, the phpSyllable library is used [Martijn van der Lee].

The theme relies on CKEditor to be installed with Filtered_HTML used for footer elements.

I recommend using the "Standard Install" of Drupal 7, as the "Minimal Install" does not 
enable modules, by default, that are required by CKEditor.

All the settings for the theme, including site name, search url, login buttons, and footer content can be 
found at http://your.site.byu.edu/admin/appearance/settings/byu2016
